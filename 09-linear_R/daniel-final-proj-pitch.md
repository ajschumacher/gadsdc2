# Daniel's final project elevator pitch

I plan on using the data provided by [yelp's dataset challege](http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge) to answer the following questions:

* How can we cluster different businesses (e.g., restaurants) using keywords from reviews and/or tips
* Can we use this clustering to improve prediction of users' ratings?

### Preliminary steps 

1. Scrape the data for key words from the reviews and tips (determin whether to use nouns, adjectives, verbs, phrases, or all of the above)
2. Use these key words to form cluster of different businesses
3. Predict usersâ€™ rating without using clusters
4. Predict users' rating using clusters
5. Measure any performance improvement
