# Interesting Dataset

[NYC Jobs][1]

##Description
This dataset contains current job postings available on the City of New Yorkâ€™s official jobs site ([http://www.nyc.gov/html/careers/html/search/search.shtml][2]). Internal postings available to city employees and external postings available to the general public are included. This data is updated weekly.

##Prior usage or write-ups
I cannot find any evidence of anyone else doing analysis on this dataset or writing about it.

##Data acquisition
I exported this file in CSV format from the [NYC Open Data][1] website to my laptop ...

 - Export
 - Download as ... CSV

... and then loaded it using the following code:

    nyc.data<-read.csv('/Users/richardgriessel/Downloads/NYC_Jobs.csv')

The R function read.csv reads a file in table format and creates a data frame from it, with cases corresponding to lines and variables to fields in the file.
