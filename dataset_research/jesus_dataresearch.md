The package I chose is ‘movies’ included in the ggplot2 package. The dataset was constructed using information from IMDB, and it has 28,819 rows and 24 variables. The dataset has information for all the variables except for budget, which has 53,573 missing values.

The dataset was created using the raw data of the movie site IMDB by Hadley Wickham. This dataset has been used to teach the fundamentals of data visualization using ggplot2. Different variations have been use in academic papers such as:
