At work I specialize in subnational trade data. For my final project, I'm thinking of improving an existing methodology 
that I use to derive industry export estimates for each metro in the U.S. using a constraint satisfaction algorithm 
that will provide more accurate estimates. I will also develop some visualizations to go along with the data to assist 
in exploratory analysis (i.e., time series graphics for industry and metro areas). An alternative idea, which I'm 
implmenting in my spare time for work, is a regression analysis of the determinants of foreign direct investment 
in US metro areas.
