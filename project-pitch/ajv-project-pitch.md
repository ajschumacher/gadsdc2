Data Science Project Pitch - Andrew Vance - 20 August

I'm sourcing my project from a present need I have at work as VP of strategy for a small business (Analytic Strategies -- www.AnalyticStrategies.com -- 50 or so personnel). I have approximately $500K annually to spend on hiring and/or outsourcing business development staff to support our growing business in logistics/supply chain management consulting and analysis. I want to assess and rank my options for optimally using that budget to support our continued business success.  Components of my question include:

1 - What potential requirements will surface between now and 31 December 2015 for which our company is optimally positioned/suited?
Method - Align our existing work and qualifications against forecast work in 2015. Rank-order relevant requirements against a defined set of criteria/classifications.

2 - Aggregating these requirements, in what markets should we apply emphasis?
Method - Aggregate ranked requirements to identify groupings/classifications.

3 - With identified markets, what sort of personnel skillset would maximize our investment?
Method - Source market-driven requirements against stated needs through LinkedIn profiles to develop an "ideal candidate profile."
